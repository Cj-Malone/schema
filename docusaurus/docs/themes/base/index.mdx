# Base Theme

Features from OpenStreetMap that provide additional context such as **land** and **water** that let users render a more complete basemap.

## Key Schema Design Choices

1. Basic classification of features into type, class, and subclass where appropriate.
2. Parsing and normalization of common OSM tags, such as `height` and `ele`.
4. Extraction of consistent OSM tags, such as wikidata to top-level properties.
3. Direct pass-thru of remaining relevant OSM tags.

## Current Types:

- [Land](/reference/base/landuse): Physical representations of land surfaces. Derived from the inverse of OSM Coastlines.
- [landuse](/reference/base/landuse): Classifications of the human use of a section of land. Mostly derived from the key `landuse` in OpenStreetMap
- [water](/reference/base/water): Physical representations of inland and ocean marine surfaces. Derived from OSM Coastlines, and the keys `natural` and `waterway` in OpenStreetMap.
