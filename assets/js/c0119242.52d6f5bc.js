Such is the case when capturing data from OpenStreetMap\n        where only a "name" tag is supplied with no further information.\n\n        Although the BCP47 language tag definition is complex, a very simplified\n        view defines a language as "language-script-region" where script and\n        region are optional. The spec lists allowed values for language, script,\n        and region. It further describes how to include variants, extensions and\n        other private custom extensions, which are allowed but not described\n        here.\n\n        For some languages, the "Suppress-Script" property in BCP47 defines a\n        script that can be omitted from the language tag. For example, the\n        "Latn" script can be omitted for the "en" language. By convention,\n        Overture will always omit the script when it matches the Suppress-Script\n        property for a language. In other words, "en-Latn" is forbidden in favor\n        of "en", and same for "ru-Cyrl" in favor of "ru".\n\n        The complete lists of allowed values can be found at:\n        https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry\n      oneOf:\n        - type: string\n          const: local\n        - type: string\n          pattern: "^[a-zA-Z]{2,3}(-[a-zA-Z]{4})?(-[a-zA-Z]{2})?$"\n          "$comment": >-\n              The "pattern" is mostly a placeholder.
